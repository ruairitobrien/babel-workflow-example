# babel-workflow-example
Just an example setup for using babel to convert ES6 to ES5 using gulp.
Also uses browserify for modules.


This is built with node so you will need node installed.

Check the source out and run `npm i` to pull down the dependencies.

Install gulp globally - `npm i -g gulp`

Run gulp from the root of the project by entering the command `gulp`

All code should be procssed and served up on http://localhost:3000

I have commited the generated files here for easy reference but you may choose to add an ignore on the public/js directory to avoid having to commit generated files.
